## K-means_ImageCompression_ColorQuantization 
The image (i.e., parrot.jpg) that you’ll be working on is size of 400 × 500 × 3. Thus, for each pixel location there are three 8-bit integers that specify the red, green, and blue intensity values. Our goal is to reduce the number of colors to 4 (i.e., K=4 in the K-means) and rep
